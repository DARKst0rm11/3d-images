# 3d-images
This technical report introduces TripoSR, a 3D reconstruction model leveraging transformer architecture for fast feed-forward 3D generation, producing 3D mesh from a single image in under 0.5 seconds. Building upon the LRM network architecture, showing that TripoSR exhibits superior performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
